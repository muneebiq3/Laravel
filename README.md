# Laravel Projects

## Overview

Welcome to my **Laravel** repository! This collection showcases various projects and assignments I developed using the **Laravel Framework** for building modern, scalable web applications. Laravel provides an elegant syntax and powerful features that make it easy to develop robust and secure server-side applications. The projects in this repository demonstrate the full capabilities of Laravel, from routing and database migrations to authentication and API development.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Build applications using Laravel's Model-View-Controller architecture for clean, organized code.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Interact with databases using Laravel's powerful Eloquent ORM, which simplifies database queries and relationships.
- **Routing & Controllers**: Manage routes and controllers to handle user requests and business logic efficiently.
- **Blade Templating**: Use Laravel's Blade templating engine to create dynamic views with clean syntax.
- **Form Handling & Validation**: Securely process and validate form inputs using Laravel's built-in validation features.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization with Laravel's built-in auth system.
- **Database Migrations**: Use Laravel's migration system to version control your database schema and easily manage changes.
- **RESTful API Development**: Build APIs with Laravel's built-in support for routing and JSON responses.
- **Middleware**: Apply middleware to filter HTTP requests and handle authentication, logging, etc.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Utilize Laravel's robust error handling and logging systems for smoother development.

## Prerequisites

To run these projects, ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Web Server** (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
2. **PHP** (version 8.2.x or later)
3. **MySQL** (or an equivalent database management system)
4. Optional: Tools like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) for easy setup.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muneebiq3/Laravel.git

2. Navigate to your desired project directory and install dependencies:
   cd <project-folder>
   composer install

3. Set up your environment:
   - Rename **.env.example** to **.env**
   - Generate an application key:
      **php artisan key:generate**

4. Create the necessary database and configure .env with the correct database credentials.

5. Run migrations to set up the database schema:
   **php artisan migrate**

6. Finally, open a command prompt (CMD), navigate to the project directory, and run:
   **php artisan serve**

7. Visit your project in a browser at:
   **http://localhost:8000**

8. Follow the project-specific instructions in the respective directories or code comments.
